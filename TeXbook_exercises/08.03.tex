EXERCISE 8.3
Look again at the error message that appears on page 31. When TEX reported
that \vship was an undefined control sequence, it printed two lines of context, showing
that it was in the midst of reading line 2 of the story file. At the time of that error
message, what state was TEX in? What character was it about to read next?


! Undefined control sequence.
l.2 \vship

?

state S (skipping blanks)
about to read `1'
