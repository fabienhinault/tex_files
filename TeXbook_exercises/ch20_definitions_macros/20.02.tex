puzzle expands to five a's.

The first a expands to b, which expands to ``A'' followed by a new definition for a.

The second a expands to its new definition, which is ``B'' followed by a newer definition for a.

The third a expands to its newer definition, which is ``C'' followed by a newest definition for a.

The forth a expands to its newest definition, which is b, which has not changed, and still
expands to ``A'' followed by a not so new definition of a.

The fifth a expands to this last definition, which is ``B'' followed by a definition for a that
will not be used.

The result is then: ``ABCAB''.
