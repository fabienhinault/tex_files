No applications of such symmetrical boxes to English-language printing were
apparent; it seemed pointless to carry extra generality as useless baggage that would
rarely if ever be used, merely for the sake of symmetry. In other words, the author

boxes were born. Time will tell whether or not this was a fundamental error!
