% too many spaces after the integer constant to have
% 24\space\space\[ considered as a <normal integer> in
% <factor> -> <normal integer>
% <normal dimen> ->  <factor> <unit of measure>
% <unsigned dimen> -> <normal dimen>
% <dimen> -> <optional signs> <unsigned dimen>
\dimen0=24\space\space pt

% NO ERROR!
% it is because of
