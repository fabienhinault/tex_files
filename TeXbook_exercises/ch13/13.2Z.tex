Why is there glue in one of these lists (modes.tex) but not in the others?

No glue in vertical mode because it begins with \\hbox straight away.
Glue in the restricted horizontal mode for the first space.
No glue in inline math mode because it has its own rules about white spaces.
No glue in internal vertical mode because nothing to put glue before switching to displayed math mode.
No glue in displayed math mode because it is like inline math mode, not much enough to have glue.

Answer:

The output of \\tracingcommands shows that four blank space tokens were
digested; these originated at the ends of lines 2, 3, 4, and 5. Only the first had any
effect, since blank spaces are ignored in math formulas and in vertical modes.
