What happens if you say  nobreak break or  break nobreak?

-- the "nobreak" has no effect. It is equivalent to "break".

Answer:

You get a forced break as if nobreak were not present, because break cannot
be cancelled by another penalty. In general if you have two penalties in a row, their
combined effect is the same as a single penalty whose value is the minimum of the two
original values, unless both of those values force breaks. (You get two breaks from
breakbreak; the second one creates an empty line.)
