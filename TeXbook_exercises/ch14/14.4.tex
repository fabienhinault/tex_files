Why is it better to type ‘Chapter\~12’ than to type ‘\\hbox{Chapter 12}’ ?

Because it allows the break ``Chap-ter 12''.

Answer:

The space you get from ~ will stretch or shrink with the other spaces in the
same line, but the space inside an hbox has a fixed width since that glue has already
been set once and for all. Furthermore the first alternative permits the word Chap-
ter to be hyphenated.
