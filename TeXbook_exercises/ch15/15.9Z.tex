Guess: count1 = 7
\count1=5 {\count1=2 \global\advance\count1by\count1
\advance\count1by\count1}
\showthe\count1
Actual: count1 = 4

count1 takes the values 5, then 2 (the old 5 is saved), then 4 (which is made
global), then 8 (and 4 is saved); finally the value 4 is restored, and that is the answer.
