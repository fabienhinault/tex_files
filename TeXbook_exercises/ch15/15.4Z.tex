Illustrations can be inserted in several ways using plain \TeX. The simplest of
these is called a “floating topinsert”; you say and TEX will attempt to put the vertical mode material at the top of the current page.
If there’s no room for such an insertion on this page, TEX will insert it at the top of
the next page. The hvertical mode materiali can contain embedded paragraphs that
temporarily interrupt vertical mode in the usual way; for example:
The caption in this example will be set ragged-right in a 3-inch column at the left of
the page. Plain TEX automatically adds a “bigskip” below each topinsert; this will
separate the caption from the text.
