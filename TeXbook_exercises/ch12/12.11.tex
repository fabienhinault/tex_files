The natural height is $-3$ pt. 
There is 6 pt to add, all taken by the vskip.
Finally, \3 is 3 pt high, 4 pt wide, and 2 pt deep.
\1's reference point is 3 pt right and 3 pt up from \3's one.
\2's reference point coincides with \3's one.

Answer:

The interline glue will be zero, and the natural height is 1 + 1 − 3 + 2 = 1 pt
(because the depth of \2 isn’t included in the natural height); so the glue will
ultimately become \\vskip-1pt when it’s set. Thus, \3 is 3 pt high, 2 pt deep, 4 pt
wide. Its reference point coincides with that of \2; to get to the reference point of
\1 you go up 2 pt and right 3 pt.
