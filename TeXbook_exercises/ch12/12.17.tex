\line{\hfil A puzzle.\hfilneg}

The sum of the fils is zero, so there's no way to fill the line box to make it wide enough.
Probably, this command throws an error.


Answer:

You get `A' at the extreme left and `puzzle.' at the extreme right, because the
space between words has the only stretchability that is finite; the infinite stretchability
cancels out. (In this case, TEXâ€™s rule about infinite glue differs from what you would
get in the limit if the value of 1 fil were finite but getting larger and larger. The true
limiting behavior would stretch the text `A puzzle.' in the same way, but it would also
move that text infinitely far away beyond the right edge of the page.)
