{\tt \\setbox3=\\hbox to3pt{\\hfil\\lower3pt\\box1\\hskip-3pt plus3fil\\box2}}
{\tt \\lower3pt\\box1} has depth 4 pt, height -2pt and width 1pt.
Naturally, \2 begins at $1 - 3 = -2$ pt, and ends at 0.
Its natural witdth is therfore 0.
3 pt remain to be added to reach the desired 3 pt. {\tt fil}s will catch them.
{\tt \\hfil} takes 0.75 pt, and {\tt \\hskip-3pt plus3fil} takes 2.25 pt.
So \3 is 2 pt high, 3 pt deep, and 3 pt wide.
\1's reference point is 0.75 pt right from \3's one.
\2's reference point is 1 pt right from \3's one.

Answer:

\3 is 2 pt high, 4 pt deep, 3 pt wide. Starting at the reference point of
\3, go right .75 pt and down 3 pt to reach the reference point of \1; or go right
1 pt to reach the reference point of \2.
