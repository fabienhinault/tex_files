{\tt \\boxmaxdepth=-4pt}

With a depth of $-4$ pt, the natural height of \4 is 16 pt. 12 extra pt for a shrinkability of 5.
the glue between \1 and \2 is $6 - 3 \times 2.4 = -1.2$ pt. \4 has dimensions: w = 1 pt, d = -4 pt,
h = 4 pt. rp1 is .4 pt above rp4, and rp2 is .4 pt below, and 4 pt left from rp4.
