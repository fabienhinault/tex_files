\def\\{$\backslash$}

Suppose that a 10 pt-wide box is to fill 38 pt of space starting 91 pt from the
left of its enclosing box. How many copies of the box will be produced by \\leaders,
\\cleaders, and \\xleaders? Where will the boxes be positioned, relative to the left
edge of the enclosing box, in each of the three cases?

Only 2 boxes will be produced with \\leaders, 3 with \\cleaders or \\xleaders.

Answer:

\\leaders: two boxes starting at 100 pt, 110 pt.

\\cleaders: three boxes starting at 95 pt, 105 pt, 115 pt.

\\xleaders: three boxes starting at 93 pt, 105 pt, 117 pt.
