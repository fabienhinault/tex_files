Let $H$ be a Hilbert space, $C$ a closed bounded convex subset of~$H$,
$T$ a nonexpansive self map of~$C$. Suppose that as $n \to\infty$, $a_{n,k} \to 0$
for each $k$, and $\gamma_n = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (a_{n,k+1} -a_{n,k} )^+ \to 0$. Then for each $x$ in~$C$,
$A_n x = \sum_{k=0} a_{n,k} T^k x$ converges weakly to a fixed point of~$T$ .


Answer

Let $H$~be a Hilbert space, \ $C$~a closed bounded convex subset
of~$H$, \ $T$~a nonexpansive self map of~$C$. Suppose that as $n\to\infty$,
\ $a_{n,k}\to0$ for each~$k$, and $\gamma_n=\sum_{k=0}^\infty(a_{n,k+1}-
a_{n,k})^+\to0$.
Then for each $x$~in~$C$,
\ $A_nx=\sum_{k=0}^\infty
a_{n,k}T^kx$ converges weakly to a fixed point of~$T$.
